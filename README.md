# CopyCat
CopyCat is a script that copies all files and directories from base directory to a new destination. If the destination doesn't exist the script creates it.

### Usage
To run the script use:
```
python copyCat.py <relative/path/to/base/dir> <relative/path/to/destination/dir>
```
or using absolute paths:
```
python copyCat.py <absolute/path/to/base/dir> <absolute/path/to/destination/dir>
```
